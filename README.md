# officeUpgrade

Script to tie together numerous MS-provided VBScript scripts which fully remove all versions of MS Office from 2003 - 2016 and Office 365. Offscrub VBScript files are copyrighted by Microsoft and are provided for historical purposes.

Can install sysadmin-provided copy of Office 2013 and 2016. Requires ripped / cloned copy of MS Office installer on referenced network share & configured MS Office Customization Tool files. While neither the installer or OCT are included for copyright reasons, sample OCT configuration files are included. Lines referencing the repair or installation functions are commented-out.

**This script will not be able to install or repair MS Office in its current state**. This would require the purchase of a valid volume license and a download of the necessary installation media.
